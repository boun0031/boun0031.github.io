  <p>Hello my name is <em>Halima Bounouri</em> and iam a student in algonquin college, iam studying IMD and it's new field to me but im really proud of myself because i get out my confort zone and tried something new, i really like to meet new people from different countries and get to know their culture and being in algonquin made that easy, i really like how our college have students from all around the world .</p> 
  <p>Traveling to another country to study was one of the biggest changes in my life and being far from family is hard specialy in canaada's weather ,but i can't wait for summer so that i can take good pictures and explore canada more. one of the best things that i enjoy in canada is eating<sup>la poutine</sup> and drinking<sup>coffee</sup>.</p>
