         <p>Nabila Bounouri is a true inspiration, a woman who turned her struggles into strength and transformed her life from being a patient to becoming one of the most renowned doctors in the world. Born with anemia, she faced numerous challenges from a young age, but instead of letting her condition define her, she used it as motivation to pursue a career in medicine. With unwavering determination, she dedicated herself to her studies, overcoming every obstacle in her path. Today, she is not only a highly respected doctor but also a symbol of perseverance and hope. Nabila is living her passion, saving lives, and proving that no challenge is too great when met with resilience and ambition. If someone asked me who my idol in life is, without hesitation, I would say my sister, Nabila Bounouri. She embodies strength, dedication, and the power of never giving up on one's dreams.</p>
